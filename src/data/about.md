# Intro

I'm a master's student majoring in Computational Science and Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/). I expect to graduate in Fall  2022 and I'm actively looking for full-time SDE position starting from Jan 2023. I'm interested in front-end development of web application, cloud computing with distributed systems, and database implementation. Before I came to Georgia Tech, I graduated from [CUHK Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's of engineering degree in Electronic Information Engineering. 


<!-- # Currently

At Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer but have broad experience across Arthenaâ€™s stack. -->
